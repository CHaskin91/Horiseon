# Horiseon_Code_Refactor

## Description

This project is our first assignment with Rice University Coding Bootcamp.  Our goal is to code refactor the Horiseon website homepage.  Our purpose of this refactoring is to make the code more efficient and accessible.  The refactoring will result in improved search engine optimization.  We are not changing the displayed styling of the page, only the underlying code.  

## Tasks

* Refactor existing HTML Elements with Semantic HTML Elements
* HTML Elements follow a logical structure independent of Styling and Positioning
* All Image Elements have accessible Alt Attributes
* Heading Attributes fall in sequential order
* Descriptive Title added
